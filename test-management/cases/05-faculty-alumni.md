# Faculty and alumni

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Screens | `/mentor/notebook`, `/mentor/mentees`, `/mentor/verifications`, `/mentor/upskilling`, `/mentor/signature`, `/mentor/leave`, `/mentor/agent`, `/alumni`, `/alumni/jobs` |
| Automated tests | [`tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`](../../tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts) |
| ID range | TC-400 to TC-499 |

Setup, the seeded accounts and the rules that link these cases to their
automated tests are in [the index](../manual-test-cases.md).

Every faculty case is run as the dev seed's faculty member,
`mentor@bgscet.ac.in` (Test Mentor), who mentors exactly one student: the dev
seed's Test Student, USN `1BG24MBA001`, Semester 2, stage `EXCEL_ADVANCED`.
REEP keeps one live session per account, so nothing else may sign in as the
faculty member, the student or the alumnus while a case runs: no other
browser, no pytest run and no other Playwright run against the same database.

Where a case says `<run id>`, use any short text that is new for this run,
for example the time of day (`1432`). The automated run uses a base-36
timestamp. It keeps repeated runs apart on the same database.

| ER-1 | 4 | The form closes and the log gains a row: Date "15 Sep 2026", the key discussions text, "Send two applications by Friday" under Follow up, and a "Watch" chip under Remarks. The row is not marked "Published", and it offers the publish button. |
| ER-2 | 5 | The row is marked "Published" beside its date, and the publish button is gone. |
| ER-3 | 6 | The student's "Faculty / TPO Log" lists the entry: the key discussions text, "Logged by Test Mentor". |
| ER-4 | 7 | The browser asks "Remove this entry? The student can already see it on their Mentor Meeting Log; it will disappear from there too." After it is accepted, the row leaves the notebook. |
| ER-5 | 8 | The entry is no longer on the student's log. |

### Post-conditions

The entry is archived, not destroyed: the API keeps it, with its revision
history, and no screen shows it. The student's browser holds a live student
session.

## TC-406 — A meeting note is refused when it is empty

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-406 |

## TC-407 — Verifications lists the pending skill claims and documents the faculty member may verify

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-407 |
| Module | Faculty: verifications |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-407` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400, and the faculty member holds "Verify skills & evidence" for the
   seeded college. The dev seed grants it as the placement office would in Who
   can do what; mentoring the student does not open this screen.
2. The dev seed's pending items for the student have not been decided: the
   skill claim "Business Analytics Fundamentals" (issued by Coursera, no file
   attached), and two uploaded documents waiting for review, "Profile photo"
   (`me.png`) and "Leadership certificate" (`leadership_completion.pdf`).

### Test data

None beyond the seeded items above.

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/verifications`.
2. On the "Business Analytics Fundamentals" claim, click Review evidence.
3. Click Close.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page is headed "Verifications", under the eyebrow "Faculty · skill verification", with a "Skill claims" and a "Documents" count chip in the header. |
| ER-2 | 1 | Under "Skill claims", a card reads "Business Analytics Fundamentals · Sectoral Skills · Certificate", "Test Student · submitted" and the date it was filed, with a "Submitted" chip and a Review evidence button. |
| ER-3 | 1 | Under "Documents", "Profile photo · Photo" and "Leadership certificate · Certificate" are listed, each for Test Student, with a "Pending review" chip, an "Open …" link naming the file, a "Reviewer note" field and Verify and Reject buttons. |
| ER-4 | 2 | The card opens and its chip reads "Under review". It shows "Badge claimed: Business Analytics Fundamentals", "Category: Sectoral Skills", "Evidence: Certificate · Business Analytics Fundamentals", "Issued by: Coursera", "Student: Test Student · 1BG24MBA001", and under "What the student told you": "Completed last week — certificate attached on my uploads." A "No file attached" chip, the "Verification rubric", the "Note to the student" field and the Verify, Request changes, Reject and Close buttons are shown. |
| ER-5 | 3 | The card closes back to its summary with a "Submitted" chip. Nothing was decided: the claim is still waiting for review. |

## TC-408 — Verify a skill claim

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-408 |
| Module | Faculty: verifications |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-408` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400, and the faculty member holds "Verify skills & evidence" for the
   seeded college. The dev seed grants it as the placement office would in Who
   can do what; mentoring the student does not open this screen.
2. The student has filed a claim to be decided. Sign in as the student on
   `/student/skilling`, and claim the "SQL" badge with a certificate: evidence
   type Certificate, the title and provider in the test data, the file
   `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf`. The automated test files the same claim
   through the API, as the student, under a file name unique to the run.
3. No other claim of the student's on the "SQL" badge is waiting for review.
   The automated test rejects leftovers from interrupted earlier runs (titles
   starting "E2E ") before it starts.
4. The student has not already earned "SQL". The dev seed does not award it.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Badge | SQL (Platform / Technical Skills) |
| Evidence title | `E2E SQL verify <run id>` |
| Issued by | `E2E Academy` |
| Certificate file | `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf` (the automated test names it `e2e-verify-<run id>.pdf`) |
| Note to the student | `E2E verified <run id>` |

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/verifications`.
2. On the "SQL" claim, click Review evidence.
3. Click the certificate's file name.
4. Enter the note in "Note to the student".
5. Click Verify.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The card shows "Badge claimed: SQL", "Category: Platform / Technical Skills", "Evidence: Certificate · E2E SQL verify <run id>" and "Issued by: E2E Academy", with a link named after the certificate file. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The browser downloads the certificate under its file name. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The claim leaves the "Skill claims" queue. "Recently reviewed" lists it first, with a "Verified" chip: "SQL · Test Student · <today> · “E2E verified <run id>”". The certificate does not appear under "Documents". |
| ER-4 | 5 | For the student, the "SQL" badge is earned, and the certificate on their Uploads screen reads Verified with the reviewer's note. |
| ER-5 | 5 | **Manual only.** On a server with mail configured (`SES_FROM_ADDRESS` set, or `BADGE_MAIL_ENABLED=true` with the console outbox), the student is emailed "Your SQL badge is verified". A development server with neither sends nothing, by design. |

### Post-conditions

The student holds the "SQL" badge, and the claim is on record as approved. The
automated test then puts the board back: the Main Admin revokes the badge and
the student deletes the certificate, both through the API. No screen revokes a
badge, so by hand the Main Admin calls
`POST /api/mentor/students/<student id>/badges/TECH-SQL/revoke` (from the API
docs at `/docs`, for example), and the student deletes the file on
`/student/uploads`.

## TC-409 — Request changes on a skill claim, which needs a note

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-409 |
| Module | Faculty: verifications |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, negative and positive |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-409` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-408, with a claim titled `E2E SQL changes <run id>`.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Badge | SQL |
| Evidence title | `E2E SQL changes <run id>` |
| Note to the student | `E2E changes <run id>: the certificate has no date` |

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/verifications`.
2. On the "SQL" claim, click Review evidence.
3. Leave "Note to the student" empty and click Request changes.
4. Enter the note in "Note to the student".
5. Click Request changes.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 3 | The card shows "Say what needs to change — the note is all the student is told, on screen and by email." and stays open. The claim is still waiting for review. |
| ER-2 | 5 | The claim leaves the queue, and "Recently reviewed" lists it with a "Needs changes" chip and the note in quotes. |
| ER-3 | 5 | For the student, the claim reads as needing more information, with the note, and the certificate on their Uploads screen reads "Needs changes": the decision is written onto it too. The badge is not earned. |
| ER-4 | 5 | **Manual only.** On a server with mail configured, the student is emailed "Your SQL badge claim needs changes", with the note under "What to change:". |

### Post-conditions

The claim stays on record as needing changes. The automated test deletes the
student's certificate afterwards. The student's "SQL" tile keeps a live row,
since only an earned badge can be revoked.

## TC-410 — Reject a skill claim, which needs a reason

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

2. On the "SQL" claim, click Review evidence.
3. Leave "Note to the student" empty and click Reject.
4. Enter the note in "Note to the student".
5. Click Reject.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 3 | The card shows "Say why it is rejected — the reason is all the student is told, on screen and by email." and stays open. The claim is still waiting for review. |
| ER-2 | 5 | The claim leaves the queue, and "Recently reviewed" lists it with a "Rejected" chip and the reason in quotes. |
| ER-3 | 5 | For the student, the claim reads as rejected with the reason, and the certificate on their Uploads screen reads Rejected. The badge is not earned. |
| ER-4 | 5 | **Manual only.** On a server with mail configured, the student is emailed "Your SQL badge claim was not verified", with the reason. |

### Post-conditions

   seeded college. The dev seed grants it as the placement office would in Who
   can do what; mentoring the student does not open this screen.
2. The student has uploaded a document that no skill claim stands on. Sign in
   as the student on `/student/uploads`, choose the Document type "Other
   document", and upload a copy of `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf` renamed to the
   title in the test data: that screen titles an upload with its file name,
   so by hand the title ends in `.pdf`. The automated test uploads it through
   the API, as the student, with the title below and a file name unique to the
   run.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document title | `E2E offer letter <run id>` |
| File | `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf` (the automated test names it `e2e-doc-verify-<run id>.pdf`) |

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/verifications`.
2. Under "Documents", find the document by its title.
3. Click its "Open <file name>" link.

| ER-2 | 3 | An "Uploaded" chip shows, the name and provider fields are emptied, and the table gains a row: the name with "Uploaded <today>", "E2E Academy", "14 Aug 2026" and "sample.pdf · 1.4 KB". The "on file" count goes up by one. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The browser downloads the certificate as `sample.pdf`. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The browser asks `Remove "E2E Power BI <run id>"? This permanently deletes the certificate.` After it is accepted, the row leaves the table and the count goes back down. |

| File | any plain-text file, for example `notes.txt`. The file picker lists only PDF, PNG and JPEG files, so switch it to show all files. The server decides the type from the file's content, not its name. |

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/upskilling`.
2. Enter the name in "Course / certificate name".
3. Click "Choose file & upload" and choose the text file.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 3 | The card shows "Upload failed. Unsupported file type — only PDF, PNG and JPEG are accepted." No row with the name is added, and the name stays in its field. |

## TC-416 — Upload, replace and remove the signature image

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-416 |
| Module | Faculty: signature |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-416` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400.
2. No signature image is on file for the faculty member. The dev seed adds
   none. If one is on file, note it, remove it first and upload it again when
   the case is done. The automated test does that through the API.

### Test data

| Field | Value |

|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page `/mentor/signature` is headed "Signature" and shows "No signature on file", the advice "PNG or JPEG, under 2 MB", and an "Upload signature" button. |
| ER-2 | 2 | "Signature saved. It appears on your leave papers from now on." is shown, with a preview of the image and "On file since <date and time> · 1 KB · PNG". Replace and "Remove…" are offered. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The same saved message shows and the preview changes to the new picture. The line under it still says PNG: the server stores every signature as a PNG. |
| ER-4 | 4 | "Your papers will show your name and the time only." is shown with "Yes, remove it" and "Keep it". Nothing is removed yet. |
| ER-5 | 5 | "Signature removed. Your leave papers show your name and the time only." is shown, and the page is back to "No signature on file". |

### Post-conditions

No signature image is on file, as before the case.

| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-418` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400.
2. The office has recorded no leave allowance for the faculty member (the dev
   seed records none). With one, a request past the allowance, or one
   overlapping an earlier request, is refused.

### Test data

The "Your leave allowance" card names the academic year and says "The office has recorded no allowance for you this year, so no request of yours is measured against one. That is not a balance of zero." |
| ER-2 | 2 | The college's form is shown: "\|\| Jai Sri Gurudev \|\|", "BGS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY,MBA", Name "Test Mentor (synced)", Sanctioned "Pending", "SIGNATURE OF STAFF" and "PROGRAM DIRECTOR". "Sign & submit to Program Director" is disabled, with "Dates and a purpose are needed before this can be signed." |
| ER-3 | 3 | Permission is the one option not struck off; Casual Leave, OOD, RH and LOP are struck off. |
| ER-4 | 4 | "Sign & submit to Program Director" becomes enabled and the hint goes. |
| ER-5 | 5 | The signed request is shown read-only: the date span ("<from> — <to>"), the purpose, "2 days", Sanctioned "Pending", "Test Mentor" and the signing time above "SIGNATURE OF STAFF", "Awaiting" above "PROGRAM DIRECTOR", the alternate-arrangement row, and a Download PDF link. |
| ER-6 | 6 | The request is listed as "Permission", "Applied <today>", its date span, with the chip "Awaiting the Main Admin". |

### Post-conditions

The request waits in the Main Admin's leave queue. The automated test
withdraws it afterwards through the API. By hand, withdraw it as in TC-420.

| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-422` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400.
2. This browser holds no leave draft. A draft lives in the browser's local

## TC-423 — Ask the REEP Agent a question as a faculty member

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-423 |
| Module | Faculty: REEP Agent |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-423` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400.
2. The faculty member's agent conversation is empty. If it is not, click
   Clear conversation first. The automated test clears it through the API.
3. No LLM provider is configured, the development default, so the agent
   answers with the Knowledge Base's approved text, word for word. With a model
   configured, the wording of the answers may differ from ER-2 and ER-3.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Suggested question | "How do I verify a skill?" |
| Typed question | `Am I placement-ready?` |

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/agent`.
2. Click the suggestion "How do I verify a skill?".
3. Type the question in the "Message the REEP Agent" box and click Send.
4. Click Clear conversation.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page is headed "REEP Agent" and carries the staff disclaimer: "The REEP Agent is a general helper — it answers on programme rules, deadlines and how REEP works, and it does not read student records. Personalised answers are only available on student accounts." The thread shows "How can I help today?" with four suggestions, and Clear conversation is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The question is shown as the faculty member's message, and the agent answers how a skill is verified ("…upload a certificate or proof of completion as evidence…"), with the source chip "Source: Verifying a skill (e.g. Power BI)" and Helpful and Not helpful buttons. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The agent answers "Personalised insights — placement readiness, your next steps, eligible jobs, skills, profile and deadlines — are available on student accounts. I can still answer policy and how-to questions." with the limitation "Personalised tools are student-only." |
| ER-4 | 4 | The thread is emptied and shows "How can I help today?" again. |

## TC-424 — A faculty member is kept out of the admin console

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-424 |
| Module | Faculty: access |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Security, negative |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-424` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400.
2. The Main Admin has granted the faculty member no admin screen in
   Governance. A grant adds a "Granted access" group to the sidebar and opens
   that screen.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/mentor/notebook` and look at the sidebar.
2. Open `/admin` in the address bar.
3. Open `/admin/students` in the address bar.
4. Open `/api/admin/students` in the address bar.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The sidebar lists exactly Notebook, Mentee Log, Student records, Leave Requests, Skill Verifications and Upskilling (Student records because they mentor a student). There is no "Granted access" group. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The app does not open the admin console. It sends the browser to `/mentor/notebook`, headed "Faculty notebook". |
| ER-3 | 3 | Again the browser lands on `/mentor/notebook`. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The API refuses: the page shows `{"detail":"You do not hold the 'Students' capability. An administrator can grant it in Governance."}`. |

## TC-425 — Alumni creates their profile on first sign-in, or edits it afterwards

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-425 |
| Module | Alumni: profile |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive and negative |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-425` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV`, and the dev seed has been applied.
2. The browser is signed in as the alumnus, `alumni@bgscet.ac.in`.
3. Which branch of the steps applies depends on the database. The dev seed
   creates the alumnus with no profile, so on a fresh database this is the
   first sign-in and the setup form is shown. Nothing in REEP deletes an
   alumni profile once saved, so on every later run the saved profile and its
   Edit form are shown instead. Both branches are expected results below.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Company | `E2E Co <run id>` |
| Designation | `Business Analyst` |
| Graduation year | `2024` |
| Resume | `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf` (1,411 bytes) |

### Steps

1. Open `/alumni`.
2. If the page shows the saved profile rather than the setup form, click Edit profile.
3. Enter the company in "Company you currently work in", the designation in "Designation" and the year in "Graduation year".
4. If the save button reads "Create my profile", click it before choosing a resume.
5. Click the resume button ("Upload current resume *", or "Replace resume" on a saved profile) and choose the resume file.
6. Click the save button ("Create my profile", or "Save changes" on a saved profile).
7. Reload the page.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page is headed "My Profile", with "Where you work now, and the resume the placement office can share." On a fresh database the setup form is shown: "Welcome back, Test Alumnus!", "Set up your alumni profile — where you currently work and your current resume.", the fields, "Upload current resume *", "PDF preferred · up to 10 MB" and "Create my profile", with no Cancel. Once a profile exists, the saved profile is shown instead: "Test Alumnus", `alumni@bgscet.ac.in` and an Edit profile button. |
| ER-2 | 2 | On a saved profile, the form is headed "Edit profile" and filled with the saved values, with "Replace resume", "Keeping: <file name on record>", "Save changes" and Cancel. |
| ER-3 | 4 | On the first sign-in only, the form shows "Upload your current resume to create your profile." and nothing is saved. A saved profile skips this step: its resume is optional and is kept when none is chosen. |
| ER-4 | 5 | A chip names the chosen file, "sample.pdf". |
| ER-5 | 6 | The profile is shown with a "Saved" chip: Company "E2E Co <run id>", Designation "Business Analyst", Graduated "2024", and the resume "sample.pdf · 1.4 KB". An Edit profile button is offered. |
| ER-6 | 7 | The same profile is shown after the reload, not the setup form. |

### Post-conditions

The alumnus has a saved profile with the test data and the resume. The setup
form is not seen again on this database.

## TC-426 — The alumni profile is not saved without a company

| Field | Value |

| Module | Alumni: profile |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, negative |
| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-426` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-425. Either branch applies: on the setup form the company field
   starts empty; on a saved profile it is cleared in step 3.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Company | left empty |

### Steps

1. Open `/alumni`.
2. If the page shows the saved profile rather than the setup form, click Edit profile.
3. Clear the "Company you currently work in" field.
4. Click the save button ("Create my profile", or "Save changes" on a saved profile).
5. Reload the page.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 4 | The form shows "Tell us the company you currently work in." and stays open. |
| ER-2 | 5 | Nothing was saved: a fresh database shows the setup form again, and a saved profile still shows the company it had before the case. |

   the API when there is none.

### Test data

None: the resume on record is used.

### Steps

1. Open `/alumni`.
2. In the Resume row, click the resume.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |

| Automated test | `tests/05-faculty-alumni.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-428` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-425 (signed in as the alumnus).
2. The dev seed's three job postings are open and unchanged: Financial
   Analyst (Acme Capital, PG, Bengaluru, skills excel and financial-modeling,
   with an apply link), BI Developer (DataWorks, PG, Remote, skills power-bi
   and excel, with an apply link) and Junior Accountant (LedgerCo, UG, Mysuru,
   skill excel, no apply link). None has a closing date.

### Test data

None beyond the seeded postings.

### Steps

1. Open the sidebar's Jobs Sheet item.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page `/alumni/jobs` is headed "Jobs Sheet", with "Openings shared by the placement office — updated weekly." and a "Search role, company or location" box. |
| ER-2 | 1 | The table's columns are Role, Company, Level, Location, Skills, Closes and an unlabelled action column. There is no Eligibility or Skill match column and no match percentage anywhere: those are computed from a student's marks and skills, which an alumnus does not have. |
| ER-3 | 1 | The three seeded postings are listed with their company, level, location and skill chips, and "—" under Closes. Financial Analyst and BI Developer each have an Apply link to the employer's page; Junior Accountant has none. |

2. Enter `ledgerco` in the "Search role, company or location" box.
3. Replace the search with `Remote`.
4. Replace the search with `zzz-no-such-job`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | Only Junior Accountant is listed. The search ignores case. |
| ER-2 | 3 | Only BI Developer is listed: the search matches the location too. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The table shows "No opening matches that search." |

## TC-430 — Skill-claim emails reach the faculty member and the student

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-430 |
| Module | Faculty: verifications |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | None (manual only): it needs real mail delivery, and a development server with no mail transport sends none by design. |

### Pre-conditions

1. A server with mail configured: `SES_FROM_ADDRESS` set on a deployment with
   SES access, or `BADGE_MAIL_ENABLED=true` on a development server, which
   writes each message to the API console instead of sending it.
2. The faculty member's and the student's mailboxes can be read, or the API
   console can.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Badge | SQL |
| Evidence title | `Manual mail check <date>` |

### Steps

1. Sign in as the student, and on `/student/skilling` claim the "SQL" badge with a certificate.
2. Sign in as the faculty member, and on `/mentor/verifications` click Verify on that claim.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | **Manual only.** The faculty member receives one email, "Test Student has claimed the SQL badge". Filing the claim again with the same request id does not send a second one. |
| ER-2 | 2 | **Manual only.** The student receives "Your SQL badge is verified", saying the badge is now marked verified on their Skilling board, with a link to `/student/skilling`. No USN, marks or certificate is in either email. |

### Post-conditions

The student holds the "SQL" badge. The Main Admin can revoke it through the
API, as in TC-408's post-conditions.

## TC-431 — The leave paper prints the faculty member's signature image

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-431 |
| Module | Faculty: leave |
| Priority | P3 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | None (manual only): whether the image is drawn in the right block of the PDF can only be judged by looking at the page. |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-400.
2. The faculty member has a leave request they submitted, and no signature
   image on file.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Signature image | `tests/fixtures/sample.png` |

### Steps

1. On `/mentor/leave`, open the request and click Download PDF.
2. On `/mentor/signature`, upload the signature image.
3. On `/mentor/leave`, open the same request and click Download PDF again.
4. On `/mentor/signature`, remove the signature image.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | **Manual only.** The paper shows "Test Mentor" and the signing time in the two staff signature blocks, with no picture. |
| ER-2 | 2 | **Manual only.** On `/mentor/leave`, a New leave request form now says "Your signature image is on file and prints above your name on the paper." instead of "No signature image is on file…". |
| ER-3 | 3 | **Manual only.** The new paper draws the image above the name and time in both staff signature blocks. The form itself is unchanged. |
| ER-4 | 4 | **Manual only.** A paper downloaded now is back to the name and time only: the paper reads whatever is on file when it is downloaded. |

### Post-conditions

No signature image is on file.
