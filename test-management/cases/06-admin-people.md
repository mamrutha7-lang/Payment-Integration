# Admin: people and access

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Screens | `/admin`, `/admin/students`, `/admin/students/:id`, `/admin/faculty`, `/admin/faculty/new`, `/admin/mentors`, `/admin/governance`, `/admin/governance/features`, `/admin/audit` |
| Automated tests | [`tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`](../../tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts) |
| ID range | TC-500 to TC-599 |

Setup, the seeded accounts and the rules that link these cases to their
automated tests are in [the index](../manual-test-cases.md).

Every case below starts from the same place unless its own pre-conditions say
otherwise: the web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the
index, with a development `ENV` (no mail transport, so links and codes are
printed to the API console instead of being emailed), the dev seed has been
applied, and you are signed in as the Main Admin, `admin@bgscet.ac.in`. Use a
browser window about 1920 pixels wide, so that every column of the roster and
faculty grids is on screen; in a narrower window, scroll a grid sideways to
read the columns on its right.

Several cases need a throwaway faculty member or student of their own, so that
nothing seeded is disabled, removed or deleted:

- **A new faculty member**: on `/admin/faculty/new`, file one under
  "MGMT · Department of Management Studies" with a unique name and a unique
  `@bgscet.ac.in` address (TC-517 walks through it), and keep the activation
  link it shows.
- **An activated faculty member**: a new faculty member whose activation link
  has been opened in a private window and a password of at least 12
  characters set on it (TC-520 walks through it).
- **A new student**: submit `/register` with a unique name, a unique
  `@bgscet.ac.in` address and a USN that is not of the form `1BG2?MBA???`, so
  that no rule seats them in a batch, then approve the application on
  `/admin/registrations`. A new student has never signed in, so their Status
  reads "Invited"; they start at stage Excel, in semester 1.
- **A new batch**: on College structure (`/admin/institution`), add a batch
  under Department of Management Studies, course Master of Business
  Administration, with a unique name, running from 1 Jul 2026 to 30 Jun 2028.
  Move the students a case names into it with the pencil on the roster (Batch).
  Other test runs leave students in the seeded batch, and a batch action
  writes to every student on the roster in that batch, so the cases about a
  whole batch use a batch of their own. When a
  case moves Test Student into it, move them back to "Master of Business
  Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B" afterwards, in semester 2 at
  stage Excel-Adv, then delete the empty batch ("Batch actions", "Remove this
  empty batch…").

Other test modules leave data behind (more students, removed accounts, more
colleges and departments), so the cases below name the seeded records they
check and give counts as they read on a freshly seeded database. Where a count
on screen depends on what else exists, the case says so.

The automated tests make these through the API, with names unique to the run,
and remove them again when the case ends. Removed accounts stay on the Removed
lists, record kept: deleting for good needs a code emailed to the office, which
no automated test reads.

## TC-539 — A batch action writes only to the students its dialog counts

| Automated test | `tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-539` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The common pre-conditions at the top of this file.
2. Test Student, in semester 2 as seeded, has been moved into a new batch
   (see the top of this file). A new student, in semester 1, has been moved
   into it too and then removed from the roster (the pencil on their row,
   "Remove or delete…", a reason, "Remove from the roster"; see TC-515), so the
   roster lists only Test Student in the batch.

### Test data

| Batch | The new batch |
| Semester to set | 3 |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/students`.

| ER-2 | 4 | The screen says "1 student: set to semester 3.", the one student the dialog counted. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The removed student is listed and is still in semester 1: a student off the roster is not moved by an action whose dialog did not count them. |

### Post-conditions

Test Student's Sem column reads 3. Put them back in the seeded batch, in
semester 2 at stage Excel-Adv. A removed student cannot be edited or moved by a
batch action, so restore the removed student (TC-515, steps 7 to 9), take them
out of the batch with the pencil and remove them again, then delete the empty
batch (see the top of this file). The removed student stays on the Removed
list. The automated test does this through the API.

Each faculty member is offered with their load: the number of students they have now "of" the capacity, as the Mentor load screen (`/admin/mentors`) counts them. On a freshly seeded database that is "Test Mentor — 1 of 20" and "<new faculty member> — 0 of 20". |
| ER-3 | 4 | The dialog closes, the screen says "1 of 1 student: assigned to <new faculty member>." and the Faculty column names the new faculty member. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The edit dialog opens with Faculty member set to the new faculty member. |

| ER-4 | 7 | The student is listed, with Status "Removed". |
| ER-5 | 8 | The edit dialog offers "Restore to the roster" in place of "Remove or delete…", and Save is disabled. |

(When the deployment has only one college the wizard chooses it by itself; with more, College starts at "Select a college".) |
| ER-2 | 3 | "Department" can be chosen and offers "MGMT · Department of Management Studies". |
| ER-3 | 5 | "Step 2 of 3" says which addresses the college admits: "BGSCET admits addresses on <its domains>." or, when it has none of its own (as seeded), "BGSCET has no domains of its own, so the deployment’s list applies." "Filed under" names "MGMT · Department of Management Studies". |
| ER-4 | 7 | "Step 3 of 3" reviews Name, College email (lower-cased), College "BGSCET · BGS College of Engineering and Technology", Department "MGMT · Department of Management Studies", Designation "—" and Role "Faculty · no functions". |

| ER-2 | 5 | The wizard stays on "Step 2 of 3" and says "A name is required." and "Type a full email address — this is the address they sign in with." |
| ER-3 | 7 | Nothing is created. The wizard says "visitor@example.com is not on this college's domains (bgscet.ac.in). Tick "outside the college domain" and give a reason if that is deliberate." and still offers "Create account & invite". The brackets list the college's own domains, or the deployment's list (`bgscet.ac.in` in development) when it has none, as seeded. |
