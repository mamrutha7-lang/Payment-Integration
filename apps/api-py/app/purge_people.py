"""Empty this deployment of PEOPLE: ``python -m app.purge_people``.

Everyone except the Main Admin, everything they did, and every recording of
them — while the institution they belong to (colleges, departments, courses,
specializations, batches) and the content the office maintains (job postings,
catalogues, the assistant's Knowledge Base) are left standing.

It exists because there is no other way to do this. `app.grant_access` creates
and updates accounts and cannot remove one; the Main Admin console deletes
students one batch at a time and has no screen at all for a faculty
account; and the Ops task menu is deliberately a FIXED LIST, because a
free-text command input there is remote code execution on the production
cluster. So a purge that has to happen on production has to be a named task on
that menu, written down, reviewed, and tested — which is this module.

WHAT IT IS FOR: handing a deployment over for real intake after it has been
demonstrated. Seeded logins, test students, voice-test leftovers, every
transcript and every recording made while proving the thing works — gone, in
one audited pass, without touching the institutional shape somebody spent an
afternoon typing in.

**Three properties make it safe to point at production.**

FIRST, EVERY TABLE HAS A WRITTEN VERDICT. `VERDICTS` below names all of them.
A table in the metadata that nobody classified ABORTS THE RUN — it is not
quietly kept (which would leave a student's records behind) and not quietly
emptied (which would destroy a catalogue somebody added last week). The next
person to add a table is made to decide, by a test that fails in CI and by this
module refusing to run. That is the whole reason the verdicts are a dict of 113
entries — one per table, `len(VERDICTS)` — rather than a pair of prefixes and a
`startswith`. (113 is the table count; the 188 below is the foreign-key count.
They were both written as "93" for months, which is how a stale number spreads.)

SECOND, THE FILES GO BEFORE THE ROWS. A row is the last pointer to a student's
resume, a faculty member's signature and a named student's recorded voice.
Delete the row first and a failed file delete leaves bytes on the volume that
nobody can find again — the one outcome that cannot be repaired afterwards.
This is `retention._delete_interview_audio`'s reasoning, applied to every other
store in `FILE_COLUMNS` (six of them since B10.3's leave attachments), and it is
why `_destroy_files` runs first and why anything it could not destroy is
reported rather than swallowed.

THE VOICE PLATFORM'S STEREO RECORDING IS THE FOURTH STORE, and it was missed for
as long as it has existed. `voice_platform/api/call_close.py` writes a
dual-channel WAV of a named student's interview to `platform/<call id>.wav` on
the same volume — a path `interview_audio.track_path` can never produce, so the
per-speaker sweep walked past it — while this module deleted the
`platform_call_sessions` row that was the file's only pointer. That is the exact
outcome the paragraph above forbids, produced by the paragraph above being
applied to three stores out of four: after a purge the volume held a complete
recording of a student's voice and nothing left in the system could say whose.
`destroy_platform_call_audio` closes it, from the ids read before the rows go.

THIRD, IT REFUSES TO LEAVE NOBODY BEHIND. The survivor is found by role, and
the run aborts unless there is EXACTLY ONE ADMIN. Zero means this deployment
has no Main Admin and the purge would lock every human out of the console
permanently. More than one contradicts the invariant `app.grant_access`
enforces at the other end, and picking one of them here would be this module
guessing which colleague keeps their job. Both are an operator's problem to fix
before the destruction, not during it.

DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. `--apply` is the only thing that deletes, and the
counts printed by a dry run are the same counts the real pass acts on. Read
them. `--apply` also demands `--i-understand-this-is-permanent`, because the
one thing a menu cannot express is that the operator meant it.

    mono mixdown and the mp3 a recording policy may ask for) under the
    interview-audio root, and `interview_audio.track_path` — the only path
    `delete_session_audio` will build — cannot produce a name in a subdirectory.
    So the per-speaker sweep ran to completion over these files and reported
    success, while `platform_call_sessions` went in the row pass immediately
    afterwards and took the last pointer to them with it.

    Handed every call the caller is taking and not only the ones whose row
    admits to a recording — `destroy_interview_audio`'s reason, and the same
    one: `recording_s3_key` records what reached the BUCKET, nothing on the row
    records what is on the DISK, and the filesystem is the authority on that. A
    call that never recorded costs three `unlink`s answering FileNotFoundError.

    This deletes the LIVE copy only. The archive sweep has taken these same
    files into the Object-Locked bucket (`app.archive_documents` recurses into
    `platform/`), which no destructor in this product may reach — the website's
    delete and the archive's permanence are promises about different copies.

    NO MANIFEST ROW IS RELEASED HERE, and that is not an omission. A row in
    `archived_documents` is written by `document_manifest.save_and_record`, the
    one choke point the six DOCUMENT stores pass through; this file is written
    by the media bridge and uploaded by the nightly sweep, which reads the disk
    and not that table, so there is no row naming it and `release` would be a
    no-op on a name it does not know. The manifest is KEEP in both destructors
    either way — see `VERDICTS["archived_documents"]` — so a row that did exist
    would keep saying whose file it was, which is the whole point of it.
