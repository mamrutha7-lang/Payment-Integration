# reason: the student card belongs under /api/interview beside the socket it

# --- The interview record endpoints (Interview Engine v3 §7) -----------------
#
# `app/routers/interview_records.py` declares its routers ALREADY PREFIXED — one
# at /api/interview and one at /api/mentor — so that `app/routers/mentor.py` is
# not touched at all by this work. That is the whole reason the module exists as
# a separate file, and it is why these are included bare rather than under the
# `prefix="/api"` the domain routers use.
#
# Two things make this include look unlike its neighbours, and both are
# deliberate:
#
# 1) THE IMPORT IS GUARDED, and on `Exception` rather than `ImportError`. The
#    module lands in the same wave as this wiring and from a different hand. A
#    missing or half-written module must degrade to "the interview history
#    screen 404s" — one feature — and never to "the dashboard does not boot",
#    which is every student's marks, attendance and jobs board gone because a
#    read-only history endpoint was not ready.
#    `except ImportError` would have covered only the ONE way this fails that
#    nobody actually hits once the file exists. A module that is present and
#    broken raises SyntaxError, NameError or AttributeError at import — none of
#    them an ImportError — and each would have taken the whole process down at
#    boot, which is precisely the outcome this guard was written to prevent.
#    Logged with the traceback (ERROR, not WARNING) because from here on a
#    failure here means a real defect in a module that is supposed to exist, and
#    "which line" is the first thing whoever reads this will need. The message
#    names exactly what is unavailable so this is diagnosed from the log rather
#    than from a student's screenshot.
#
# 2) THE ROUTERS ARE DISCOVERED, not named. §7 specifies two of them and does not
#    fix their variable names; guessing `router` and finding `student_router`
#    would mount NOTHING while raising nothing — a silently missing API surface,
#    which is the exact failure this codebase keeps writing comments about. Every
#    public APIRouter the module exposes is mounted, and the names and prefixes
#    are logged, so what got served is a fact in the log rather than an
#    assumption. The `/api/` requirement is a real contract check, not a filter
#    of convenience: the Angular client's `environment.apiBase` and the dev proxy
#    (apps/web/proxy.conf.json) forward `/api` and nothing else, so a router
#    mounted anywhere else is unreachable from the app that needs it.

# --- The development-only MCP surface ----------------------------------------
#
# LAST, and deliberately so: fastapi-mcp reads the app's OpenAPI schema to build
# its tool list, so every router must already be included or the tools it
# publishes are a subset of the API by accident of ordering.
#
# Two gates, both in settings.mcp_enabled: the ENV must be on the development
# ALLOWLIST (never `not is_prod` — an unrecognised ENV has to lose the
# affordance, not gain it) and MCP_DEV_SURFACE must spell "true". The mount
# forwards the caller's session cookie into the real handlers, so on a host
# serving real students it would be a second front door with none of the rate
# limiting, revocation or audit the first one has.
#
# app/dev_mcp.py imports fastapi_mcp INSIDE its function: the package is in
# requirements-dev.txt only, the Dockerfile installs requirements.txt, and CI's
# dependency-completeness job imports every module under app/ against that same
# manifest. With the flag off this line is the only thing that runs.
