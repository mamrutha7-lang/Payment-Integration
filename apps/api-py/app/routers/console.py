# B8.4 REMOVED `GET /overview`, `GET /mail` and `GET /job-imports` from this
# module (2026-09-13), and the reason is worth leaving behind.
#
# All three were reachable, capability-gated and correct, and NOTHING CALLED
# ANY OF THEM: no Angular caller, and no client of any kind. `/overview` in
# particular computed five programme-wide counts with NO `scope_filter` on it
# at all, so it was the one admin aggregate a scoped grant could not narrow —
# a B1.4 hole kept open by an endpoint nobody was using. Its replacement is
# `GET /analytics-summary` below, which answers the same question through the
# reach and stamps the scope header.
#
# `MailLog` and `app/mailer.py` are UNTOUCHED: the mail is still recorded and
# still deduplicated: only the read endpoint is gone. `job_import_runs` went
# with its endpoint, and took `jobs.import_run_id` with it (migration
# f1a7c93d5e26) — B8.1's `import_runs` is the import provenance now, for the

    office saying the recruiter has withdrawn it, which a date cannot express
    and cannot be back-dated into without lying about when applications closed.

    IDEMPOTENT. Closing a closed posting returns it unchanged and writes no

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# B8.5 — the weekly series and the KPI strip
#
# WHY EVERY NUMBER HERE IS NULLABLE AND EVERY SERIES CARRIES ITS OWN SOURCE.
# The Analytics board asks for four weekly series and six KPIs. Three of the
# series and three of the KPIs are answerable from the tables that exist; the
# rest are not, and each is not-answerable for a DIFFERENT reason. The shape
# below makes the reason travel with the number, because the alternative — a
# zero, or a series of zeros — is indistinguishable on a chart from a real
# collapse, and the office would act on it.
#
# READINESS HAS NO HISTORY, and that is the sharp one. `placement_readiness` is
# computed from the state of a student's records AS THEY ARE NOW: there is no
# record of what their CGPA or attendance was in week 7, so "readiness % in week
# 7" cannot be recovered from any table in this database. It is answerable for
# the CURRENT week and for no other, until `analytics_snapshots` (B8.6) has been
# written for a few weeks by a nightly job — which is an EventBridge schedule,
# i.e. an infrastructure change nobody has approved. So this endpoint computes
# every point it can and marks the readiness series `partial`, with the last
# point filled and a sentence saying why the rest are empty. It does NOT read
# `analytics_snapshots`: nothing writes that table yet, and a read path against
# an empty table is a chart that silently shows nothing.
#
# SCOPED (B1.4), through the same reach as the tiles beside them. The ratios on
# this screen must be reproducible from each other; a series narrowed
# differently from `analytics-summary` would draw an attendance line that does
# not match the attendance the same reader sees on the roster.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

#: The longest window the series will answer for. Twelve weeks is the board's
#: default; the cap is here because `?weeks=` is a query parameter and an
#: unbounded one is a full table scan of `attendance_records` an anonymous
#: typo can ask for.
MAX_SERIES_WEEKS = 52

#: A readiness score at or above this is "placement ready" — the floor of
#: `routers/student.py::_readiness_band`'s top band, named once here so the
#: cohort percentage and the word on the student's own card cannot drift.
PLACEMENT_READY_SCORE = 80

#: Above this many students in reach, the readiness roll-up is not attempted.
#: `compose_readiness_many` is six queries however large the set, so the bound
#: is on the Python pass and the memory it holds, not on the database. Reported
#: as unavailable WITH the count rather than silently truncated: a percentage
#: over the first two thousand students of a larger set is a number nobody can
#: reproduce.
MAX_READINESS_ROLLUP = 5000


#: The four lines, in the order the board draws them. Named once so the

    """The placement funnel, the yearly KPIs, the by-track split and the recent offers.

    SCOPED (B1.4) through the student, which is still the only route there is:
    an offer hangs on a `students` row, and although B12.1 has now given `jobs`
    a college and a course, an offer's `job_id` is NULLABLE — an off-campus
    offer a student typed in themselves has no posting behind it — so narrowing
    through the posting would silently drop exactly the offers nobody else
    records. The student is the join that always lands.

    `?cohort_id=` NARROWS WITHIN THE REACH AND CANNOT WIDEN IT, as
    `mentor_load`'s two filters do: it is an extra predicate over the reach's
    own, so asking for a batch the caller does not hold returns zeros rather
    than somebody else's figures. Re-validation is the shape of the query rather
    than a second check that could one day disagree with the first.

    `?year=` NARROWS THE OFFERS, NOT THE ROLL. The KPIs are "yearly" in the
    sense the board's Period filter means: offers submitted in that calendar
    year, over the students on the roll TODAY. Ageing the denominator as well
    would need a roll-as-of-date that nothing records, and inventing one would
    make last year's rate move every time somebody is added to a batch.

    FOUR OF THE FIVE FUNNEL STAGES ARE COUNTED AND THE FIFTH IS NAMED. Nothing
    in this schema records a recruiter's interview round: `interview_sessions`
    is the REEP MOCK interviewer, a rehearsal a student can sit four times in an
    afternoon with no recruiter involved, and drawing it between "applied" and
    "offered" would put a rehearsal count in a hiring funnel — a wrong number
    rather than a missing one, which is the distinction the placement screen's
    own header comment refuses to blur. `interviewed` is therefore `null` with
    its reason in `unavailable`, and it stays that way until something records a
    round. "Shortlisted", the board's sixth stage, has the same problem and is
    not named at all: a stage that will never be counted is not a gap, it is a
    feature nobody has asked to build.

    The funnel's stages are all narrowed by one reach, so the ratios between
    them stay readable. `top_recruiters` counts only offers inside it, which
    means a scoped reader sees the recruiters OF THEIR OWN students — the
    question that screen is asked.
