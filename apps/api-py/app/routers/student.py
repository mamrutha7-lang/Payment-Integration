    ANY account with a `students` row. Graduation flips `users.role` to ALUMNI
    and deliberately KEEPS the `students` row — it is the record of their marks,
    badges and interviews — so on the role check alone a graduate kept a valid
    `studentId` and with it roughly forty endpoints across this module,
    student_programme.py and badges.py: results, ledger, uploads, resume
    generation, SWOC acknowledgements. The Angular `roleGuard('STUDENT')` bounced
    them off the SCREENS, so the symptom would have been an API wide open behind
    a client that looked closed.

    It is not only graduation. `registrations`' GUARD 2 refuses to attach a
    Student row to a staff account precisely because `studentId` would then ride
    in a MENTOR's session; that guard is one write path, and this is the read
    side of the same fact. The role is what decides scope (rule 2). The claim
    only says which row.

#
# THE BUILDER'S CONTENT IS WHAT THE DOCUMENT IS MADE OF, and until this was
# written it was not. The composer read the `student_profiles` row, the verified
# skills and the academic record — and nothing else. So a student could fill all
# fifteen sections of the builder, watch the sidebar climb to 100%, press
# Generate, and receive a five-line page carrying none of their experience,
# internships, projects, publications, certifications, positions, objective,
# achievements or referees, printed under a card that told them the resume was
# "drawing on your full record". The builder wrote `resume_profiles.data`; no
# reader existed. The screen said the work had landed and the document said it
# had not, which is the worse of the two ways to be wrong.

#: What a builder section contributes is decided HERE, by name, and that is the
#: point: the resume builder is also the placement office's intake form, so
#: `resume_profiles.data` holds material an employer must never see and that the
#: screens have already promised will not travel — `family` (next-of-kin,
#: "only used where the placement office requires next-of-kin details"),
#: `basic.dob` ("Used for placement eligibility only — not shown on your
#: exported resume"), `basic.medical_history` ("visible to your mentor and the
#: placement office, never to recruiters"), gender / blood group / marital
#: status, `basic.dream_company` (an aspiration addressed to the office),
#: `policy` (the student's acceptance of the placement terms) and `goal` (which
#: posting this copy is aimed at). The street lines and postal code of an
#: address are the office's delivery detail; a resume carries a city.
#:
#: A denylist would publish the NEXT section someone adds to the builder by
#: default, and the first person to find out would be the student, in front of
#: an employer. So nothing reaches the page unless a function below puts it
#: there, and `tests/test_resume_document.py` fills every section with a marker

    `write_bytes` directly on the event loop — the loop every live interview's
    audio shares. A deadline-week upload burst produced 100-300 ms loop stalls
    (audible glitches in every running interview), and under pool contention
    the sync checkout parked the loop for the full pool timeout. In the
    threadpool, the only thing this endpoint can stall is itself. The one
    await it needed, `file.read()`, is `file.file.read()` here — same bytes,
    same SpooledTemporaryFile, no coroutine.

# --- Leaderboards --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE BOARD IS THE BATCH (2026-09-22). A student who registered naming a batch,
# was approved and seated in it, opened Leaderboards and saw none of their
# batch mates. Two things did that, and both are fixed here rather than in the
# client.
#
# ONE: a board listed only the students who already HELD something on it (the
# 2026-09-17 rule, kept — a "Rank 2 of 30" over a zero is a lie), so a fresh
# batch with no verified skills and no results yet drew "No ranking yet" for
# everybody, and nothing on the screen said the classmates were there at all.
# The board now carries the batch mates who are NOT yet ranked as a second,
# unnumbered list, so the student sees their batch and sees who is ranked.
#
# TWO: a student with `students.cohort_id` NULL — provisioned before the form
# copied the requested batch onto the row, or granted with `--department-id`
# alone — was "ranked" among every other NULL-cohort student on the
# deployment, which is not a batch and never was. The scope is resolved by
# `_leaderboard_scope`: the batch where there is one, else the department
# (`students.department_id`, the same second pointer `ancestry_of_student`
# reads), else nobody — and the response SAYS which, in words the screen
# prints, because "you are not seated in a batch yet" and "your batch has no
# results yet" are different sentences with different fixes.
#
# And the boards rank ONE component each. `overall` is the rank across all of
# them: skills, VTU results, streak and mocks, each worth up to
# OVERALL_POINTS_PER_COMPONENT scaled against the best in the batch, summed to
# a score out of 100. Scaled rather than summed raw because a CGPA is out of
# 10 and a streak is out of however many days the term has run — added
# unscaled, the streak would BE the leaderboard.

    # rather than a threshold this function invented: the composer's weight
    # picker is the one control a mentor has for "this matters". A board with
    # nine 3s produces no actions, which is correct — the screen exists to carry
    # observations, not to nag about every one of them.
    #
    # THE TWO HEAVIEST ONLY. `actions[:5]` below is a cap on the list, not on any
    # one source, so six weight-5 weaknesses would push the overdue certification
    # and the profile fields off a student's next-actions card entirely — the
    # board would have quietly taken over a list it is one input to.
    #
    # "WHILE IT IS UNADDRESSED" IS THE AUTHOR'S TO ANSWER, and unlike B6.3's
    # drill this one already has a mechanism: the mentor lowers the weight or
    # deletes the line. That is a real human lifecycle on an existing screen, so
    # nothing here needs a flag nobody presses. The student's own acknowledgement
    # deliberately does NOT clear it: "I have read this" is not "I have done
    # something about it", and letting a tap remove the action would make the one
    # honest signal the student sends into a way of hiding the line.
    #
    # THE ROUTE COMES FROM THE LINK (B7.6's other half), and that is the reason
    # these two halves are one task. `NextActionOut` requires a `cta_route` and a
    # sentence about a person has no natural destination; a linked skill,
    # interview or posting does. With no link the route is the board itself,
    # where the line is drawn in full beside the meeting it came out of.
    #
    # READINESS IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED, and this is the one place a reader
    # will look for it. 04 asks for "readiness and next-actions"; adding an
    # eighth `ReadinessFactorOut` would (a) move `MIN_SCORED_WEIGHT_SHARE`'s bar
    # under everybody — the comment on that constant spells out what happened the
    # last time a factor was added and the fraction was not re-derived — and
    # (b) score a student DOWN for a colleague's written opinion, which has no
    # cut-off, no import behind it and no way for the student to answer it. Every
    # other factor is a measurement against a stated threshold. A SWOC line is a

#: or a mock interview fills. So on a fresh deployment, scoring "over the

#: not yet typed their phone number lands on **0/100 — Not ready**, in a 27px
#: numeral, where the old broken arithmetic at least said 17. Both are verdicts
#: on evidence that does not exist; the new one is simply a harsher way of being
#: wrong.
#:
#: A score over a sixth of the evidence is not a score. Below this share the
#: honest answer is that there is not enough on record, said in words, with the
#: per-check chips underneath still showing exactly what is and is not known —
#: which is more use to a student than any number would be.
#:
#: IT IS A JUDGEMENT AND NOT A DERIVATION, and it is expressed as a FRACTION so
#: that adding a check does not silently move the bar. The judgement is: the two
#: checks that cannot be missing are nowhere near sufficient on their own, and
#: EITHER of the imported pairs — marks (6), or two of {attendance 2,
#: certifications 2, mock interview 2} — crosses it in company with them.
#:
#: It read `0.5` while the rule carried six checks weighing 12, and 6/12 was
#: exactly the attendance-plus-certifications case. B6.3 added a seventh check
#: worth 2, and leaving the number at 0.5 would have quietly RAISED the bar:
#: 6/14 is 0.43, so a first-semester student with attendance and certifications
#: imported but no results yet would have stopped being scored on a deploy that
#: changed nothing about them. `3/7` is the same judgement over the new total —
#: every combination that crossed before crosses now, and the only new ones are
#: the two that pair the mock interview with attendance or certifications, which
#: is the same shape as the pair that already crossed. Move it and a cohort's

    the three rungs above them: the student's COURSE row, then their COLLEGE
    row, then the programme-wide row.

    programme-wide row still answers it.
