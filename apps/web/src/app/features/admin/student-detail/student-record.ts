/**
 * What the Student 360 screen reads, and the small pure functions that dress it.
 *
 * One place for the five payloads this screen asks the API for, and for the
 * dressing that turns them into the sentences the board prints. The component
 * holds the behaviour; a reader chasing "what is actually on this student"
 * reads this file and does not have to open a screen to find out.
 *
 * Every shape here is the EXACT snake_case body of an endpoint that exists on
 * `main` today. Nothing is modelled ahead of its endpoint — a client interface
 * for a payload nobody serves is the first half of a screen that quietly
 * renders invented data.
 *
 * `Student360Out` IS DECLARED NOW BECAUSE IT IS SERVED NOW. B4.5 landed
 * `GET /api/admin/students/{id}/360` (`app/routers/admin_student_360.py`), and
 * it is the read this screen was built around the absence of: the identity
 * block it returns is the roster's own `AdminStudentOut`, so the card at the
 * top of the detail screen and the row in the grid behind it cannot disagree.
 *
 * EVERY MISSING NUMBER ON THAT PAYLOAD IS `null` AND NEVER `0`, which is the
 * server's rule as much as this screen's: `results` is null for a semester with
 * no marks imported, `best_interview_score` is null when nothing was scored,
 * and the per-semester activity counts are null whenever the dates that would
 * attribute them to a semester were never recorded. A client that renders any
 * of those as a zero states a fact nobody measured.
