/**
 * The resume's GOAL — which role, where, and against which posting.
 *
 * A resume is only "good" relative to something. The builder used to be a
 * 15-section form with no target, so completeness was the only feedback it could
 * give and "80% complete" said nothing about whether the document would survive
 * the job the student actually wanted. The goal makes that judgement possible:
 * every downstream step (tailor, preview, export) reads it.
 *
 * IT PERSISTS THROUGH THE PROFILE MAP. ResumeBuilderService.data is an opaque
 * section-key map that round-trips to /student/resume-profile, so `goal` rides
 * along with it and needs no endpoint of its own. The backend's completeness
 * calculation counts a FIXED list of section keys, so an extra key cannot
 * inflate the percentage.
 *
 * THE MATCH NUMBER IS THE SERVER'S, NOT OURS. `match_percent`, `eligible` and
 * `reasons` come from GET /student/jobs, which applies the per-posting CGPA and
 * live-backlog gates. Recomputing a match here would produce a second, quieter
 * answer that could disagree with the Jobs screen — and the one thing this
 * screen must never do is tell a student they are eligible when the gate says
 * otherwise.
